# BRASS (Basic RoR API Store Setup ðŸ˜…)
Experimenting with store architecture through a RoR API.

After a few years of comercial work, a fresh view on basic store architecture. Dynamic and playful, will likely keep changing over time, as the wind blows...

Chose RoR due to my familiarity with the framework. The quick (and familiar) installation process allows to start writing the actual logic in a breathe. OOP and ecommerce do get along; Rails "convention" concept invites to write clean code, readable and easy to follow; code updates, new functionalities and logic refactors are also quick to write. On the downside, certain RoR performance concerns have been traditionally raised and Ruby magic can sometimes be a bit overwhelming. But overall a nice and fast choice to experiment with.

I will start from scratch, and might or might not use a few usual gems. Some common functionalities such as user authentication will be implemented as needed in the future: right now basic store framework and db architecture are the main focus.

API documentation will follow.
